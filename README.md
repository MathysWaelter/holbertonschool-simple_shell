## Description


Shell is a UNIX term for the interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is the layer of programming ðŸ•¹

It collects information from you and runs programs based on that information. When a program finishes running, it displays the output of that program.

Shell is an environment where we can run our shell commands, programs and scripts. There are different versions of a shell, just like there are different versions of operating systems. Each type of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.

### Installing

* No installation is required
* it's native to your operating system

### interest of a shell

* Controls all computer operations.
* Coordinates all executing utilities
* Ensures that executing utilities do not interfere with each other or consume all system resources.
* Schedules and manages all system processes.
